    <h2>4. Disclaimers and Limitations</h2>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>4.1 Safety Predictions Are Estimates Only</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Halo's safety predictions are statistical estimates based on historical crime data and machine learning models.
            They are NOT guarantees of safety or danger. Crime can occur anywhere, at any time, regardless of predicted risk levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do NOT rely solely on Halo predictions for personal safety decisions.</strong>
            Always use common sense, stay aware of your surroundings, and follow local safety guidance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>4.2 No Emergency Services</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Halo is NOT an emergency service.</strong>
        In case of immediate danger or emergency:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Call 112</strong> (Swedish emergency number)</li>
        <li><strong>Call 114 14</strong> (Swedish police non-emergency)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Do NOT rely on Halo incident reports as a substitute for contacting emergency services.
        Incident reports may have delays and are not monitored 24/7 by authorities.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Data Accuracy Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>While we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All crime incidents are reported in the app (some may be missing from official sources)</li>
        <li>User-submitted reports are verified or accurate</li>
        <li>Safety predictions reflect real-time conditions</li>
        <li>Maps and location data are precise (GPS can have errors of 5-50 meters)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4 Service Availability</h3>
    <p>
        We provide Halo on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis.
        We do not guarantee that the service will be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Available 24/7 without interruption</li>
        <li>Free of errors, bugs, or technical issues</li>
